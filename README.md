## Technology Stack

- **Front-End Framework:** The project is primarily built using React, a popular and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. TypeScript is integrated into the development process, adding static typing and enhanced code quality.

- **Styling:** The website is styled using CSS, and for an improved development experience, Emotion is employed as the CSS-in-JS solution. Emotion provides a straightforward way to write and manage component styles.

- **Routing:** Navigation between pages is managed by React Router, which allows for smooth client-side routing and URL management.

- **State Management:** The application state is effectively managed using React's built-in state management capabilities and hooks. Context API may be used to share state between components when necessary.

- **API Communication:** Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests to the backend API, ensuring seamless data retrieval and synchronization.

- **Form Handling:** Form validation and handling are facilitated by libraries like Formik and Yup, providing a user-friendly experience for form interactions.

- **Authentication:** For secure user authentication, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are implemented. Users can log in, register, and perform authorized actions securely.

- **Back-End Integration:** The front-end interacts with a robust and well-structured Node.js and Express.js back-end. Communication with the server is facilitated through RESTful API endpoints.

- **Database:** MongoDB serves as the database to store user profiles, product details, and other essential data. Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling library, is used to facilitate interactions with the database.

- **Deployment:** The application is hosted on a versel.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured folder architecture to maintain code organization and separation of concerns. Components are organized based on their functionalities, making it easier for developers to navigate and maintain the codebase.
